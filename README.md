# Instructions for MovieSearch

MovieSearch is designed to help you practice using what you learned in this Unit. To complete this challenge you will need to be familiar with closures and asynchronous calls, NSURLSession, failable initializers, parsing through the returned data from network APIs, and working with network API documentation.

Please fork and clone this repository, then watch the screen recording provided before starting. This will show you what you need to build. Your project must allow a user to search for a movie by name, and should display search results either in a table view or collection view. The results should show the movie title, rating, summary, and poster.

The documentation for the API you should use can be found at http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#. The documentation has examples of movie searching, and should be sufficient guidance for you to complete the project. The only additional hint I will give is the url for fetching the movie's image, since it is pretty difficult to find: http://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/\(imageEndpoint)

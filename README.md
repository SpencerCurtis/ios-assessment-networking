Please fork and clone this repository, then watch the screen recording provided before starting. This will show you what you need to build. 


The documentation for the API you should use can be found at https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started. The documentation for this API is a little harder to navigate than what you might be used to so be sure to spend a sufficient amount of time going over the documentation to make sure you find the correct URL to use and that you can get sample JSON. **You will also need to register for an API key if you do not have one already.** 

**You will have 3 hours and 30 minutes to complete this challenge.**

Your project must:

1. Allow a user to search for a movie by name 
2. Display search results either in a table view or collection view. 
3. The results should show the movie title, rating, and summary.
4. Display the poster of each movie on your custom cell (Hint, the URL for fetching a movies image is: http://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/(imageEndpoint))
